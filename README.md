## I found a bug, what do I do?

I'm happy to hear any feedback regarding the library or it's implementation, be it critizism, praise or rants. Please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pgerke/freeathome-local-api-client/issues) or drop me an [email](mailto:info@philipgerke.com) if you would like to contact me.

I would especially appreciate, if you could report any issues you encounter while using the library. Issues I know about, I can probably fix.

If you want to submit a bug report, please check if the issue you have has already been reported. If you want to contribute additional information to the issue, please add it to the existing issue instead of creating another one. Duplicate issues will take time from bugfixing and thus delay a fix.

While creating a bug report, please make it easy for me to fix it by giving us all the details you have about the issue. Always include the version of the library and a short concise description of the issue. Besides that, there are a few other pieces of information that help tracking down bugs:

- The system environment in which the issue occurred (e.g. node version)
- Some steps to reproduce the issue, e.g. a code snippet
- The expected behaviour and how the failed failed to meet that expectation
- Anything else you think I might need
